For this reason it is not a complete neither and optimal algorithm because it doesn't always find a solution and it neglects neighboring nodes of an expanded one. The A* algorithm however, is an optimal one because it will always find the cheapest path to the goal node, and is complete because it will always find a solution (assuming there is no infinite loop). The downside of A* is that it stores all the nodes in memory, performing an exhaustive search, thus it isn't very memory efficient.\"\"\""
